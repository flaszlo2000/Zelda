### if you want to add a new file with existing data loader
1. add the filename without the extension to the game_essentails/data/models/__init__.py 's HANDLER_MAP
    - for this you will need a data representation class (inherited from GameData), this will be only a dataclass model

### if you want to add a new type of file:
1. add the file extension to the game_essentails/data/loaders/__init__.py 's DATA_LOADERS
    - with this you will need a DataLoader, you can easily create yours in the same folder's data_loader.py, the only abstract method is the **loadData**

#### NOTE
.md files shouldn't be considered as a file to parse as configuration to be able to place readmes and logs for instance as that type


### Stat related stuff

you can define stat with StatData, it is able to provide a regen mechanics just by configuring the values from the config files.  
Just an example from players.json:  
```
"health": {  
        "base": 100,  
        "max": 300,  
        "initial_upgrade_cost": 100,
        ...
}
```

Just by adding these lines:

```
        "can_be_regened": true,
        "regen_amount_percentage": 1,
        "regen_rate_in_sec": 0.5
```

you can achive a stat that will be increased by every **half** of a second with an amount of **1 percent** of the max value.

`can_be_regened` _(bool)_:  notifies the loading system about the regeneration ability of a stat  
`regen_rate_in_sec` _(optional float)_: defines the delay between regens  
`regen_amount_percentage` _(optional float)_: defines the amount of stat can be regenerated by a time  
`regen_max_percentage` _(optional float)_: determines the max percentage of the stat's max which can be regened  
`depends_on` _(optional List[str])_: gives additional dependencies which will be used for calculating the **regen_amount_percentage** with this formula: regen_amount_percentage *= dependent_stat.base. You can use this to make a stat that is dependent on an other stat

### Effect vs Magic
Magic is immediate and effect could take time. (Curse/Buff/etc)
Effect can produce it's benefits/disadvantages **perTick** or at the **end** of time it takes.
Effect uses the same interface which the regen system.
